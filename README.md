# kata-babysitter

Requirements: https://github.com/PillarTechnology/kata-babysitter

This project uses Python 3 with no extra libraries.

Run tests:

  python3 -m unittest discover

Run calc_pay function:

  Go into python shell 'python3'

  Type 'from calculate_charge import calc_pay'

  Use calc_pay to calculate the babysitter's pay

  Example: 'calc_pay('5:00PM', '3:00AM', 'c')'

  Time must be in HH:MMPM format since that is what the requirements had written.

  Any minutes will be rounded down since requirements stated that babysitter gets paid for full hours.

  The third parameter is the family which is a, b, c. Can be upper or lower case.


  Enjoy!
